# Discord-Rich-Presence

Discord Rich Presence is a Rich Presence (RPC) client that show the channel, user or group you're talking to. You don't want people to think you have secrets, do you?

## Tutorial

1. Fork/download this project to your computer.
2. Go to [the Applications-page](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) and make a new application. The name should be whatever you want to be in the status, ex. if I want it to say "Playing With Users In Chillzone Discord Server".
3. Go to the tab called Rich Presence > Art Assets. Scroll down and add images you would like to be displayed on the RPC. Make sure to give them names! (See #Image Reference)
4. **Copy** (don't delete or rename) `config.json.example` and rename it to `config.json`
5. Change the properties of the configuration. (See #Configuration)

## Image Reference

TL;DR

## Configuration

`*` = anywhere in the config

- `appid` The application ID. `string`
- `interval` Delay in seconds it will update. If you're experiencing lag, you might want to bump this up. `number`
- `...discord.details` What it will display in the RP when chatting in a group, channel or to a user. `array.string`
- `...sleep.details` Some text it will display in the RP when sleeping. `string`
- `...sleep.state` Additional text when sleeping. `string`
- `*.largeImageKey` Name of the large image you want. `string`
- `*.largeImageText` Text you want to show when hovering over the large image `string`
- `*.smallImageKey` Name of the small image you want. `string`
- `*.smallImageText` Text you want to show when hovering over the small image. `string`
- `*.startTimestamp` Display time since the RPC updated. `true/false`
- `*.endTimestamp` Display time until the current task (ex. sleeping) is done. `true/false`
- `*.joinButton` Display a "Ask to Join"-button that's greyed out (since it's not a game). `true/false`
- `*.spectateButton` Same as above, just as a "Spectate"-button. `true/false`
- `sleepTime` When you go to sleep. (See #Sleep Times)

## Sleep Times

```elixir
"sleepTime": [
        [ 22, 7  ],
        [ 22, 7  ],
        [ 22, 7  ],
        [ 22, 7  ],
        [ 22, 7  ],
        [ 23, 10 ],
        [ 23, 10 ]
    ]
```

Each array is it's own day, first is Monday, last is Sunday etc etc. My schedule is like this;

I go to bed at 22pm if there's work tomorrow, and wake up 7am. If it's not work tomorrow, I go to bed at 23pm and wake up the next day 10am.
